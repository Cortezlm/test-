# Challenge today is to create a script that list all the devices on the network and ask the user to ping one of the ip address.
# There is a few different ways to list all deivices on your network you could use an arp command or an nmap command.
# We will run the a command that prints all address then ask the user to ping a specific one by entering an ip address.

# "arp -n"
echo "all devices on network"
arp -a
echo "enter ipaddress"
read ip_address
echo "ping $ip_address"
ping $ip_address
